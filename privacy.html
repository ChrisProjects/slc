<p>We Build Toolbars LLC d/b/a Mutual Public (hereinafter

  and has developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment
  to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information

  read this Privacy Policy carefully when using any of our website or
  services (the “Services”) or transacting business with us. By using
  our website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy
  Policy. Please note that we are based in the United States of America.
  As such, any personal information you provide us with or is collected
  by us as detailed below is transferred to and processed by us in the
  United States of America (or other countries). By registering or subscribing
  to the Services, you agree to this transfer and processing. If you have
  any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of
  this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us.</p>

  some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your
  name, address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact
  business with us, financial information such as your payment method
  (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial
  information). We also collect information about your interests and activities,
  your gender and age, and other demographic information such as your

<p>Information Collected by Third Party Advertisers.
  We may allow third-parties, including our authorized service providers,
  advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on
  our site. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies,
  to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements.
  Our website does not provide any personal information to these third
  parties. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements
  and gauge their effectiveness. We do not control these advertisers or
  advertising networks or any other third parties whose websites may be
  linked from our Services. We recommend that your review the privacy
  statements of all third-party websites you visit.</p>
<p>Social Networking Sites. When you use the Services
  through a social networking site (a “Social Networking Site”), such

  site. The information you permit SLC to access varies by Social Networking
  Site and is affected by the privacy settings you establish at such site.

  SLC to collect, store, retain, and use indefinitely, in accordance with
  our Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed the Social
  Networking Site could provide to SLC through the Social Networking Site
  application programming interface. Your agreement takes place when you
  “accept” or “allow” (or other similar terms) our application

  that SLC currently has may be stored, retained, and used indefinitely,
  in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

  cookies. Flash cookies are managed through a different interface than
  your web browser and you can access your Flash cookie settings here.
