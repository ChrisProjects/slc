as set forth on the Services) as they become due plus all related taxes
(including without limitation sales and use taxes, duties or other governmental
taxes or fees), and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest
for any overdue amounts. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and
there are no refunds or credits for any partially used subscription
periods except (i) as expressly set forth in this Agreement, (ii) as
otherwise required by applicable law and (iii) at SLC's sole discretion.
Fees for the Paid Services may be payable in advance, in arrears, per
usage, or as otherwise described when you initially purchase the Paid
Services. All prices for Paid Services are subject to change without
notice.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times','Arial';font-size:12pt">Payment Method. SLC may, from time to time, offer various payment
methods, including without limitation payment by credit card, by debit
card, by check, by certain mobile payment providers or by online services
like PayPal. SLC charges you for Paid Services through the payment method
you select when you initiate the Paid Services (the “Payment Method”)
and you agree to make payment using that Payment Method. Certain Payment
Methods, such as credit cards and debit cards, may involve agreements
between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other
provider of your chosen Payment Method (the “Payment Method Provider”).
If we do not receive payment from your Payment Method Provider, you
agree to directly pay all amounts due upon demand from us. Your non-termination
or continued use of the Paid Services reaffirms that we are authorized
to charge your Payment Method.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times','Arial';font-size:12pt">Automatic Renewal of Subscriptions. IF YOU PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION

AS INVOLVING AN AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION) AND YOU DO NOT
CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AS SET FORTH IN THE “CANCELLATION OF SUBSCRIPTIONS”
SECTION BELOW PRIOR TO THE END OF THE TERM, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE
AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED AT THE END OF EACH TERM FOR SUCCESSIVE RENEWAL
PERIODS OF THE SAME DURATION AS THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM ORIGINALLY SELECTED
(FOR EXAMPLE, UNLESS YOU CANCEL, A ONE MONTH SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY
RENEW ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND A SIX MONTH SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY
RENEW ON A SIX MONTH BASIS). UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED IN ANY APPLICABLE
ADDITIONAL TERMS, SUCH RENEWAL WILL BE AT THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION FEE
AS WHEN YOU FIRST SUBSCRIBED, PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES, UNLESS WE NOTIFY
YOU AT LEAST 10 DAYS PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR CURRENT TERM THAT THE
SUBSCRIPTION FEE WILL INCREASE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR
PAYMENT METHOD WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED FOR SUCH SUBSCRIPTION FEES,
PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES, UPON EACH SUCH AUTO RENEWAL. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IS SUBJECT TO AUTOMATIC RENEWALS AND YOU CONSENT
TO AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL RECURRING CHARGES TO YOUR CREDIT
OR DEBIT CARD (OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD, AS APPLICABLE) BASED ON THIS
AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FEATURE WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU AND
WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE RECURRING CHARGE MAY CHANGE IF THE APPLICABLE
TAX RATES CHANGE OR IF YOU ARE NOTIFIED THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE
IN THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEES.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times','Arial';font-size:12pt">Cancellation of Subscriptions. TO CHANGE OR CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION
AT ANY TIME, GO TO THE “MANAGE ACCOUNT” PAGE OF YOUR ACCOUNT, CLICK
ON “CANCEL MEMBERSHIP” AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. IF YOU CANCEL
YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS OF YOUR INITIAL ORDER,
YOU WILL BE REFUNDED THE COST OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR
SUBSCRIPTION AFTER THIS PERIOD, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BENEFITS WILL CONTINUE
UNTIL THE END OF YOUR THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM, BUT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION
WILL NOT BE RENEWED AFTER THAT TERM EXPIRES. YOU WILL NOT RETAIN ANY
SLC TOKENS OR SLC POINTS THAT YOU EARNED. YOU WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO
A PRORATED REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEES PAID FOR THE
THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</span></p>

Payment Method is canceled (for example, due to loss or theft) or if
you become aware of a potential breach of security related to your Payment
Method. If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you
acknowledge that your current Payment Method may continue to be charged
for Paid Services and you remain responsible for all such charges.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times','Arial';font-size:12pt">Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged varies from
the amount you authorized when purchasing any Paid Services (other than
due to the imposition or change in the amount of taxes, including without
limitation sales and use taxes, duties or other governmental taxes or
fees), SLC will provide notice of the amount to be charged and the date
of the charge at least 10 days before the scheduled date of the transaction.
You agree that SLC may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as
one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:12pt"><span style="font-family:'Times','Arial';font-size:12pt">Incorrect Payments and Errors. In the event that you submit to us

discretion, to (1) return or refund all or some of the amount of your
payment, (2) apply all or some of your payment amount to other similar
Paid Services that have a purchase price less than the amount of your
